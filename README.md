There's a first time for everything.
I'm an aspiring UI designer. I know Sketch, have used and deployed fair to middling HTML and CSS, and some jQuery (yes, I know, I know, old stuff). In addition to doing more of those, maybe not more jQuery, I'll probably be keen to see about picking up a Javascript framework/library, and most likely will be taking a look at the React library, see what the action is.
