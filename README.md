There's a first time for everything
I'm an aspiring UI designer, and know some HTML, CSS, and have used jQuery (yes, I know, I know, old stuff). I'll probably be keen to see about picking up a Javascript framework/library, and most likely will be taking a look at the React library, see what the action is.
